Console App
===========

Simple app that tests reading in characters from the console to the app.

Example Output
--------------

```
Got character: t
Got character: o
Got character: c
Got character: k
Got character: O
Got character: S
```

Notes
-----

Receiving on the console with multiple apps is currently undefined behavior, so
this app should be run on its own.
