Courses
=======

The Tock team periodically puts on courses teaching various aspects of Tock.

Tock is a fast-moving project and courses are sometimes a bit specialized,
which means the materials here may fall somewhat out of date over time.
However they are still a good starting point.

Each course README includes pointers to commits for both libtock and the Tock
kernel at the time the course was taught. If you're interested in running
through the course, please hop back in time to ensure everything works as
planned. If find anything that does not work or is confusing, please feel free
to [open an issue](https://github.com/tock/libtock-c/issues/new) or even better
to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/tock/libtock-c/pulls/new) with a
suggested fix.

**Happy Hacking!**
