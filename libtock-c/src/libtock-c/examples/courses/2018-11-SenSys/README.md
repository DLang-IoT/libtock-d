SenSys 2018 Tutorial
====================

In November 2018 we hosted [a tutorial at SenSys](https://www.tockos.org/events/sensys2018),
a preeminent conference for networking, sensors, and systems.

The goal of this tutorial was to explore how multi-tenancy can cause problems
(one buggy app draining system [energy] resources) and also provide solutions
(via management that allow runtime monitoring and correction).
The tutorial begins with a general overview of Tock and its programming
environment, then considers application development and management, and finally
digs into the 802.15.4 and UDP/IP capabilities in Tock.

**If you are interested in doing this tutorial yourself, please
