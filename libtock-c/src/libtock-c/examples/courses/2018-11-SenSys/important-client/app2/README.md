UDP Sensor App
==============

Your customer needs to periodically measure the environment around their board.

This app is for platforms with hardware RNG support, environmental sensors, and
an 802.15.4 radio. The app will broadcast periodic sensor readings over the
network. Currently, it sends UDP packets using 6lowpan to a single neighbor
with an IP address known ahead of time.  The contents of the payload (which are
serialized to JSON) include:

1. A random number, generated by the application accessing the underlying hardware RNG.

2. Three sensor readings (temperature, relative humidity, and light).

## Running

To run this app, simply place the IP address of the destination node in the `dst_addr` struct.
Notably, until Tock has neighbor discovery implemented, you also have to configure
the destination MAC address in the kernel (in `boards/imix/src/main.rs`).

### UDP Layer Reception Test

The best way to test this app is by using the UDP reception app on another Imix.
Program the kernel on two imixs. On one imix load this app to send packets. On
the other imix load the `sensys_udp_rx` app found in
`userland/examples/sensys_udp_rx`. You will want to set the
`PRINT_STRING` macro to `1` for maximum visibility.

If everything is working, you will see packets printed on the console.
These lines contain the payload of the received UDP packet.
